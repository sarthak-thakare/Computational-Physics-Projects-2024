This repository contains solutions to the Week 1 assignment for the Computational Physics course. The assignment covers various numerical methods in physics using C++, including solving nonlinear equations, initial value problems, and systems of linear equations. The methods implemented are:

1) b{Newton-Raphson Method}: Finding roots of nonlinear equations, including solving a specific quadratic equation and a geometric problem involving a circle.
2) Secant Method: Solving the equation f(x)=exp(2x)+x−5 using the Secant method.
3) Euler’s Method: Solving an initial value problem using Euler’s method with various step sizes and comparing the results with the exact solution.
4) Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4): Solving the same differential equation as Euler’s method but with a more accurate RK4 method.
5) Solving Linear Systems: Using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods to solve a system of linear equations.
